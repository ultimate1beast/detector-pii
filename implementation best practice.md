# Implementation Best Practices

## SOLID Principles

This project adheres to SOLID principles throughout its design:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Each module has a clearly defined responsibility:
  - `db-scanner`: Database connection and metadata extraction
  - `data-sampler`: Data sampling strategies
  - `pii-detector`: PII detection algorithms
  - `api-gateway`: API endpoints and orchestration
  - `common`: Shared models and interfaces

- Each class within modules has a single responsibility:
  - `DatabaseConnectionProvider`: Only handles database connections
  - `MetadataExtractor`: Only extracts metadata
  - `DataSampler`: Only samples data
  - `PiiDetector`: Only detects PII

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- The system is open for extension but closed for modification:
  - New database types can be added by implementing `DatabaseConnectionProvider` without modifying existing code
  - New sampling strategies can be added by extending `AbstractDataSampler`
  - New PII detection strategies can be added by implementing `PiiDetector`

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Implementations can be substituted for their interfaces:
  - Any `DatabaseConnectionProvider` implementation can be used wherever the interface is expected
  - Any `DataSampler` implementation can be used wherever the interface is expected
  - Any `PiiDetector` implementation can be used wherever the interface is expected

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Interfaces are focused and minimal:
  - `DatabaseConnectionProvider` only defines methods for connection management
  - `MetadataExtractor` only defines methods for metadata extraction
  - `DataSampler` only defines methods for data sampling
  - `PiiDetector` only defines methods for PII detection

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations:
  - `JdbcMetadataExtractor` depends on `DatabaseConnectionProvider` interface, not concrete implementations
  - `PiiDetectionFacade` depends on `PiiDetector` interface, not concrete implementations
  - `DataSamplingService` depends on `DataSampler` interface, not concrete implementations

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern

- `DatabaseConnectionFactory` creates appropriate connection providers based on database type
- Centralizes creation logic and encapsulates implementation details

### Strategy Pattern

- Different PII detection strategies (`HeuristicPiiDetector`, `RegexPiiDetector`, `NerModelPiiDetector`)
- Different data sampling strategies (`RandomSampler`, `ParallelSampler`)
- Allows for runtime selection of algorithms

### Facade Pattern

- `PiiDetectionFacade` simplifies access to multiple PII detection strategies
- Hides complexity of parallel execution and result aggregation

### Template Method Pattern

- `AbstractDataSampler` defines the skeleton of the sampling algorithm
- Subclasses like `RandomSampler` implement specific steps

### Builder Pattern

- Used extensively in model classes through Lombok's `@Builder` annotation
- Makes object creation clear and maintainable

### Adapter Pattern

- Mappers like `MetadataMapper`, `SamplingMapper`, and `PiiMapper` convert between internal models and DTOs

## Performance Optimization

### Connection Pooling

- Use connection pooling to reduce the overhead of creating new connections
- Configure appropriate pool sizes based on workload

### Parallel Processing

- Use `ParallelSampler` for large tables to distribute the load
- Configure parallelism based on available CPU cores and database capabilities

### Pagination and Limits

- Always use limits when querying databases to avoid excessive memory usage
- Implement pagination for large result sets

### Caching

- Consider adding caching for frequently accessed metadata
- Use Spring's caching abstraction with an appropriate cache provider

## Memory Management

### Stream Processing

- Use Java streams for processing large datasets without loading everything into memory
- Consider using reactive programming for very large datasets

### Sample Size Control

- Configure appropriate sample sizes based on available memory
- Implement adaptive sampling strategies for tables of varying sizes

### Resource Cleanup

- Always close database connections, statements, and result sets in finally blocks or try-with-resources
- Use `@PreDestroy` to clean up resources before application shutdown

## Error Handling

### Exception Hierarchy

- Use the custom exception hierarchy for specific error scenarios
- Ensure exceptions include meaningful messages and context

### Graceful Degradation

- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls (like the NER service)
- Have fallback strategies when a component fails

### Comprehensive Logging

- Log all exceptions with appropriate context
- Use different log levels appropriately (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)

## Security Best Practices

### Sensitive Data Handling

- Never log sensitive information or credentials
- Mask PII in logs and responses where appropriate

### Secure Database Access

- Use principle of least privilege for database users
- Consider using database-level encryption for sensitive data

### Input Validation

- Validate all input parameters before processing
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Code Quality

### Automated Testing

- Write unit tests for all components
- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Use test containers for database integration testing

### Code Style

- Follow a consistent coding style
- Use static analysis tools (SonarQube, Checkstyle, etc.)

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs with Javadoc
- Keep README and deployment documentation up to date

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- Design services to be stateless for horizontal scaling
- Use distributed caching if needed

### Database Load

- Implement throttling for database operations
- Consider read replicas for heavy workloads

### Asynchronous Processing

- Use asynchronous processing for long-running operations
- Implement a job queue for database scanning operations

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Metrics

- Expose JVM and application-specific metrics
- Track database connection usage, query times, and sampling performance

### Health Checks

- Implement health checks for all components
- Include database connectivity in health checks

### Distributed Tracing

- Implement tracing to track requests across components
- Add correlation IDs to logs for request tracking

## Integration with External Systems

### API Versioning

- Version APIs to support backward compatibility
- Use hypermedia (HATEOAS) for API discoverability

### Resilient External Calls

- Implement retry mechanisms for external service calls
- Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
